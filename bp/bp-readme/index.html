<h1>current features:</h1><ul>

<li>browse booths at comiket</li>

<li>search for circles</li>

<li>add booths to your shopping list by rating them from 1-9</li>

<li>shopping list is color-coded according to score and sorted by rows, same order as in the comiket hall</li>

<li>draw your shopping list onto the comiket map in realtime, right on your phone</li>

<li>downloads all the booths to your web browser localStorage (cache) for less data consumption, similarly saves your shopping list to localStorage as well, no dependency on any sort of server</li>

<li>from the shopping list page: switch an entry between purchased and todo with two taps, or browse the links in the catalog, or add additional links (crossfades) and notes, change rating, etc</li>

<li>copy an entire tweet into the "paste here" field on the "Show all booths" page to automatically detect the first comiket booth and display it below -- try this example: 2日目(日曜日)東シ-81aにて頒布予定です。<br /><strong>note: you need to have bp set to the correct day first</strong></li>

<li>export your shopping list to a json file which can be imported to a laptop or whatever (currently imports will overwrite the current shopping list, a merge feature will be added)</li>

<li>possible to do all this fully offline by saving the html file and json files to your phone (more on this later, requires any android phone, works without root) <strong>termux + <code>python3 -m http.server</code></strong> for example</li>
